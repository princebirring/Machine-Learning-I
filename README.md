Instructor: Dr. Richard Xie | https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardxy

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course is an introduction to Machine Learning and its core models and algorithms for students in the Data Science Program. The objective of the course is to provide students an overview of machine learning techniques to explore, analyze, and leverage data.  This course cover; supervised, unsupervised, and common techniques in data processing. Students will be familiarized with broad machine learning and statistical pattern recognition topics, including: neural network training, classification, regression, support vector machines. Students will use Python to complete the projects through the course.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

1.	Understand machine learning algorithms and concepts.
2.	Demonstrate Machine Learning technics using Python.
3.	Train, test and validate neural network models for machine learning concepts.
4.	Understand the core concept of supervise, and unsupervised learning.
5.	Apply the machine learning concepts to practical problems.
